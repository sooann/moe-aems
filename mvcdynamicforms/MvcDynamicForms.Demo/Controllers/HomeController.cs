        /*
         * First off, these Demos do the exact same thing from the end user's perspective.
         * The difference is in how the Form object is persisted across requests.
         * 
         * Most often, you'll need to keep the original Form and Field objects around for as long 
         * as your user is working on completing the form. This is because, when InputField 
         * objects are constructed, they are keyed with a new Guid. See Demos 1 & 2 for examples.
         * 
         * You can key your InputFields manually by setting the InputField.Key property.
         * If you do this and can guarantee that the Fields and their Keys will not change after
         * a complete reconstruction of all objects, then you don't have to persist the objects across
         * requests. See Demo 3.
         * 
         * In Demo 1, the Form object graph is serialized to a string and stored in a hidden field
         * in the page's HTML.
         * 
         * In Demo 2, the Form object graph is simply stored in TempData (short lived session state).
         * 
         * In Demo 3, the Form object graph is not persisted across requests. It is reconstructed
         * on each request and the InputField's keys are set manually.
         * 
         * The serialization approach (demo 1) results in more concise code in the controller. 
         * Serializing the Form is also more reliable, in my opinion.
         * 
         * However, response time increases because of serialized data 
         * and the (de)serialization process takes time, as well.
         * 
         * The approach you take depends on your needs.
